# Effective way of representing 3D geometry in the form of a signed distance function (SDF) from mesh objects into SDF format.
## It uses learning a feature grid alongside and applying transformations to feature vectors from the grid and do training a separate neural network on each object

Metric folder contains results with time, occupancy F1 for points near the surface and occupancy F1 for points in bounding volume of the object
